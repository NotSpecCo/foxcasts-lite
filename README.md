# Foxcasts Lite

Please note: This is currently in the middle of a rewrite, so things will be changing and possibly breaking.

## Navigation

- Up/Down on the d-pad will scroll through menus and lists
- Left/Right on the d-pad will navigate back and forward

## How to Install

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Build the app

```
npm run build:dev
```

3. Load the `build` folder as a packaged app using your Web IDE of choice (I like Waterfox Classic)
