# Foxcasts Lite

Please note: This is currently in the middle of a rewrite, so things will be changing and possibly breaking.

## Navigation

- Use the d-pad to scroll through menus and lists

## How to Install

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Build the app

```
npm run build:dev
```

3. Load the `build` folder as a packaged app using your Web IDE of choice (I like Waterfox Classic)
